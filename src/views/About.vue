      I am a full-stack javascript developer currently working as an Analyst Tools Developer at Darktrace. I recently graduated from an 18 week course at Founders and Coders, based in Finsbury Park, London. I am looking for opportunities that will further my technical growth as well as allow me to invest my time in social-impact projects comitted to making a real, positive difference in the world.

      At my current role I experience working both client and server-side, and also occasionally work in a DevOps role, working on continuous integration and depoloyment through cloud services (AWS). I enjoy all aspects of programming and would love to remain in a full-stack position but if I had to choose one, due to my mathematical and academic background I would be most comfortable in server-side software development, finding great satisfaction in working with APIs, databases and functionality. I would hope to find a role that will allow me to continue to learn more and push me to challenge myself and look at problems in ways I would previously not have considered.

      Before I began my journey in web-development I studied Economics at the University of Sheffield, with an emphasis on the mathematic and statistical aspects of the subject. Economic theory is still of great interest to me and I am fascinated by the economic principles, models and drivers that shape individual consumers' and society's choices as a whole.
